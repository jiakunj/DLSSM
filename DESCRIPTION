Description: Implements the dynamic logistic state space model for binary outcome data proposed by Jiang et al. (2021) <doi:10.1111/biom.13593>.
 It provides a computationally efficient way to update the prediction whenever new data becomes available.
 It allows for both time-varying and time-invariant coefficients, and use cubic smoothing splines to model varying coefficients.
 The smoothing parameters are objectively chosen by maximum likelihood. The model is updated using batch data accumulated at pre-specified time intervals.
